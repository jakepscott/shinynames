# Shiny Names

Very simple Shiny app built in R that allows a user to explore the evolution of given names over time in the US. This was built to help me refresh myself on Shiny. Not meant to be stunningly gorgeous or groundbreakingly insightful, just meant to be a fun way to pass the time!

## Getting Started

The easiest way to *use* the app is just to go to the website: https://jake-scott.shinyapps.io/shinynames. To run the app locally on your own computer, just copy the code from the Names_Function and app files and run it in R.

### Prerequisites

You don't need anything if you run it on the website! To run it on your computer you just need R and the following packages installed and loaded:

```
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
library(ggthemes)
library(shinythemes)

```
