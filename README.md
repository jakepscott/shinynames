# Shiny Names!
This is a super simple Shiny app I designed in R. The purpose of the project was simply to refresh the basics of Shiny. It is not meant to be jaw-droppingly gorgeous or earth shatteringly informative, just a neat way to explore the evolution of names over time in the United States.

## Getting Started
The best way to run the app is just on the website: https://jake-scott.shinyapps.io/shinynames. To run it on your computer simply copy the code from the app.R file and put it in R!

### Prerequisites
To run the app on your computer you just need R with the libraries below installed and loaded. 
```
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
library(ggthemes)
library(shinythemes)
```
